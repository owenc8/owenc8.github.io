            <h1> Flax Home UX Research</h1>

            <h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>

            <p class = "projtext">Wilet is a female-founded company based in Vancouver, BC offering 100% linen products such as bedding and various home goods- providing everyday luxury and comfort. We got in touch with them for this UX research project through one of our group members.
            </p>

            <p class = "projtext">In our initial discussion with Wilet (previously Flax Home), they expressed that their website was primarily built for desktop usage although over 50% of their customers are mobile users. Through this evaluation and the design recommendations we provide, we hoped to optimize the mobile shopping experiences for their target users.</p>

            </div>
        <p class = "projtext">Before coming together as a group we each took a look at the mobile site to see if we could find any potential problems with how information is displayed and interactive features. The interface was evaluated using Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design.

        <p class = "projtext">Afterwards we grouped each of our observations to better understand the areas with more frequent issues. Eventually is was found that the product bundles and listings were areas that went against the most heuristics.</p>

        <h2 >User Testing</h2>

        <p>In addition to conducting our own background research, the team at Flax Home provided us with Google analytics data to get a better sense of who their customer base was. This was important since we had to recruit our own users for the testing and we wanted them to accurately represent the people who would visit the site. Before starting the user tests, we sent out the consent forms and a pre-test questionnaire to get a better understanding of user shopping habits and behaviours when it came to shopping for bedding. I recruited three participants through help from a family member.</p>

        <p>7 female participants aged 25-45 were recruited with each completing a 1 hour long moderated usability test over Zoom.

        </div>
    <p class = "projtext">For the test, we asked participants to share their screen on their mobile phone and use the “think-aloud” method to take us through their process while completing the given tasks. One team member led the study at a time by going through multiple scenarios and asking questions, while 1-2 other members took notes to record qualitative data points.

        <h2>Findings</h2>

        <div class = imgContainer>

            <div class = imgBox >
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/flax ux/affinity map flax.png" alt="mobile broadcasts" class = "singleImg2">
                    <figcaption>Group affinity map in Figma based on comments from study participants</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

           
            
        </div>

        <p class = "projtext">The main pain points we observed were with confusing terminology such as "shams vs pillowcases" and the bundles feature where many participants were confused about having to make two distinct colour/ size selections for the bundles. Some participants did not notice the second selection.


        </p>

        <p class = "projtext">Other issues came from scrolling which created an unclear hierarchy, some participants had issues finding the "add to cart" button and previewing colour selections was difficult due to excessive scrolling.</p>

        <h2>Prototype</h2>

        <p>Following the first round of user testing, two prototypes were created to help solve the issues presented in the affinity map.</p>
        <div class = imgContainer2>

            <div class = imgBox3 >
                <img src="img/flax ux/flaxflow1.png" alt="mobile broadcasts" class = "singleImg2">
                <figcaption>Prototype 1</figcaption>
            </div>

            <div class = imgBox3 >
                <img src="img/flax ux/flaxflow2start.png" alt="mobile broadcasts" class = "singleImg2">
                <figcaption>Prototype 2</figcaption>
            </div>

            <div class = imgBox3 >
                <img src="img/flax ux/flaxflow2end.png" alt="mobile broadcasts" class = "singleImg2">
            </div>
            
           
            
        </div>

        <p class = "projtext">A final round of testing was done with 4 more participants to compare between two prototypes on mobile. The first prototype involved adding images next to the colour selection, with further details about the product below with dropdowns to conserve space. The second prototype let the user review what was in each set initially, then taking them through individual pages to select colour. Prototype 2 was the favourite because of the step by step process. In addition, participants preferred the way product details were displayed upfront which more clearly set thier expectations on the bundling process.

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>


        <p class = "projtext">Overall it was an interesting experience getting to work with a real company to help make recommendations for their interface. Learning how to recruit and interview users was also helpful, since it gave me a better perspective on what needed to be adjusted in the interface. It was also useful since in a normal project we as the designer have a chance of being biased to our own work and thinking it is completely optimal. In this project we were only able to recruit 11 total participants which is a limitation in terms of validity. If done again I wish we could have recruited more people for testing.  A group of 5 was the largest team I have had to work with academically so that posed challenges such as distributing work and making sure everyone's ideas were heard.
