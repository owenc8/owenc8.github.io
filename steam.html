            <h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>

            <p>This project was individual and took place over three weeks. The goal was to develop a new feature for a mobile application out of a pool of 10 apps, for my project I chose Steam mobile. 
            </p>

            <h2 >First Steps</h2>

            <div class = imgContainer>

                <div class = imgBox2 >
                    <img src="img/steam/broadcasts.png" alt="mobile broadcasts" class = "singleImg2">
                    <figcaption>Screenshot of mobile streaming page</figcaption>

                <div class = imgBox2 >
                    <img src="img/steam/marketlist.png" alt="mobile library"  class = "singleImg2">

                </div> 
                
            </div>
        <p class = "projtext">Before doing any sketching or prototyping I conducted research on my own by doing short interviews with two current users of the app to get a feel for what the app is for, what features they use most often, and areas where it could be improved. The two users and their most used features were the left image which is the market listing page and the right image which is the market feature. I also had to familiarize myself with the design language of Steam mobile because one of the objectives was to have our feature integrate as seamlessly as possible into the existing interface.

        <section class = projectSection>
            <h2>Sketching solutions</h2>

        <div class = imgContainer>
            <div class = imgBox2 >
                <img src="img/steam/followFeaturesketch.jpg" alt="follow button sketch" class = "singleImg2">
                <figcaption>Sketch of follow feature for broadcasts</figcaption>
            </div>
            
            <div class = imgBox2 >
                <img src="img/steam/selectAllsketch.jpg" alt="sketch of elect all"  class = "singleImg2">
                <figcaption>Sketch of select all button for marketplace</figcaption>
            </div>

            
        </div>


        <p class = "projtext">For the second section of the project I had to sketch wireframes for two potential features to lay out where they would go and what it would look like. One of which involved a follow button pictured in the image above on the left , and a select all button shown in the next image for when users confirm their Steam market listings.

        </p>

        <p class = "projtext">Eventually I found that the broadcasting section of the app was a greater area for exploration because there were more ways the problem could be addressed in contrast to the market listing solution that could be fixed with one button.

            <h2>Final prototypes</h2>
        
        <div class = imgContainer>
            
            <div class = imgBox2 >
            <img src="img/steam/streamstatusNEW (1).png" alt="streamerstatus" class = "singleImg2" >
            <figcaption>Status of currently followed broadcasters</figcaption>

            <img src="img/steam/followbuttonNEW (1).png" alt="followbutton" class = "singleImg2" >
            <figcaption>Follow button</figcaption>
            </div>

   

            <div class = "imgBox2">
                <img src="img/steam/steamfilter (1).png" alt="filter" class = "singleImg2">
                <figcaption>Filter broadcasts by category</figcaption>
            </div>
    
        </div>
        
    

        <p class = "projtext">In the final stages of the project I used the prototyping tool UXpin to create my design. The biggest challenge I faced was finding a way to expand upon my follow button in the top right because the solution was not that complex. I did this by giving the user more options to easily search for streams they might want to watch by introducing a set of filters as seen in the phone preview, that they can toggle on and off. When a user finds a stream they like and follow, they can also access a tab shown in the top right, so that they know when a streamer is online in the future.
