        <p class = "projtext">Monkeypaw productions has previously made digital content for the post film viewing experience through the Candyman Social Impact Initiative website. However, the company misses an opportunity to have more engaging content like this on their main website, which could provide a more unique and meaningful experience to fans who want to learn more about the films.

        <p class = "projtext"> Over the course of the project the team went through different approaches to content design. Through short design sprints we came up with out inital ideas which revolved around breakdowns of their films pertaining to their cinematography and lighting. And later breaking down historical and social themes present in their films. However these goals for content were aspirational and either didn't have enough existing media we could draw from or focussed too heavily on historical topics that we didn't have a wealth of expertise on.
        </p>

        <p class = "projtext">Ultimately the incorporation of contemporary social themes and traditionally underrepresented voices makes Monkeypaw Productions unique. Our final approach was to centralize content from interviews of the director for each film with the goal of showcasing how they implemented these social themes within the films. Alongside this it was also proposed to have content about the actors and how the specific film impacted their careers, and displaying the overall positive impact the film had.</p>

        <p class = "projtext">How might we encourage fans to engage with Monkeypaw's official website, enabling them to develop a deeper understanding of the film's social themes in order to reinforce Monkeypaw's brand values and deepen fan's appreciation of the film?

        <p class = "projtext">I implemented the dragging interaction again for the film specific sections. Each film is broken down into multiple themes which are them explored through quotes from the director, in the case of Get Out(2017) pictured here, we drew from interviews of Jordan Peele. Clips from the film are accompanied by clickable annotations for additional insight on narrative decisions made in the selected scene.

            <p class = "projtext">This was project intense due to the ammount of time designing the structure for new content, and learning how to create more complex interactions in Figma. Since this was a large project it was important that we each had defined roles so that we could work together effectively.
