        <p class = "projtext">Monkeypaw productions has previously made digital content for the post film viewing experience through the Candyman Social Impact Initiative website. However, the company misses an opportunity to have more engaging content like this on their main website, which could provide a more unique and meaningful experience to fans who want to learn more about the films.

            </div>
        <p class = "projtext"> Over the course of the project the team went through different approaches to content design. Through short design sprints we came up with out inital ideas which revolved around breakdowns of their films pertaining to their cinematography and lighting. And later breaking down historical and social themes present in their films. However these goals for content were aspirational and either didn't have enough existing media we could draw from or focussed too heavily on historical topics that we didn't have a wealth of expertise on.
        </p>

        <p class = "projtext">Ultimately the incorporation of contemporary social themes and traditionally underrepresented voices makes Monkeypaw Productions unique. Our final approach was to centralize content from interviews of the director for each film with the goal of showcasing how they implemented these social themes within the films. Alongside this it was also proposed to have content about the actors and how the specific film impacted their careers, and displaying the overall positive impact the film had.</p>
