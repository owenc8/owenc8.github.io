            <h2 >Overview</h2>

    
        <p class = "projtext">Monkeypaw Productions is an American film and television production company founded in 2012 by Jordan Peele. This film production company places an  emphasis on imaginative storytelling, tackling social issues, prioritizing traditionally underrepresented voices, and challenges genre norms from horror to science fiction and social satire.

            <div class = imgContainer>

                <div class = imgBox2 >
                    <img src="" alt="mobile broadcasts" class = "singleImg2">

            </div>
        <p class = "projtext"> Over the course of the project the team went through different approaches to content design. Inital ideas revolved around breakdowns of their films and their cinematography and lighting. And later breaking down social themes present in their films. However these goals for content were aspirational and either didn't have enough existing media we could draw from or involved sensitive topics that we didn't have a wealth of expertise on.
        </p>

        <p class = "projtext">Ultimately the incorporation of contemporary social themes and traditionally underrepresented voices makes Monkeypaw Productions unique. Our final approach was to centralize content from interviews of the director for each film with the goal of showcasing how they implemented these social themes.</p>
