            <h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>

            <p >The main objective for this project was to re-design a company logotype and brochure. Terramera is an Agtech company that focusses on developing eco friendly agriculture products and is based in Vancouver BC.
            </p>
            <p>For the logotype there were some restrictions placed on our designs. One was that no colour was to be included in the design, and two is that no excessive “graphical” elements besides letters themselves could be implemented, such as imagery of a flower, or anything that would resemble a drawing.</p>

            <p class = "projtext">At first I started with sketches on paper where I experimented with font weight as well as both serif and san serif fonts. After hand sketches were completed, the process of transferring them to InDesign began. I settled with a rounder logotype design because I wanted to represent the word Terra meaning earth in Latin. I then played around with the weight/thickness of the letters. After choosing the thin version of the logotype, I made finer adjustments such as the spacing between each letter to refine my design.

            <p class = "projtext">This is the final logotype that I designed for this project. The last major change I made was including a leaf in the eye/opening of the one of the capital R's. Through feedback from the teaching assistant, the addition of the leaf was permitted since it did not take away focus from the logotype itself. I thought this would make the company's relation to plant and agriculture products more apparent than the previous version.

                <li>More consistent alignment of text within columns was needed because some text was left aligned and some was center aligned.</li>

                <li> Info could be a smaller font size as the focus of the brochure is on the product, hierarchy of information should have been considered more.</li>
                
                <li>Image with people could be better suited for contact section as it shows the types of people you might expect at the company.</li>
                
                <li>Size difference between header and sub header was not clear and could impact clarity of sections.</li>

            <h2>Challenges and takeaways</h2>
            <p class = "projtext">In terms of challenges I faced, they mainly revolved around creating a logotype that matched the identity of the brand. I had to look into company values and had to think of metaphors as well. Creating a layout that made sense was also a challenge.
