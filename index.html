			<p>
				I am a 3rd year student currently at Simon Fraser University studying interactive arts and technology.  Although I am still exploring my interests in design, my current motivations include user interface design and graphic design. As a designer you have to be adaptable as both trends and software are an ever changing environment. To accomplish this I have experience with design and prototyping tools such as Adobe InDesign and UXpin, and I also have experience in coding languages like Java so I can better understand both ends of the spectrum.
